# Snow-Crash (42) — Project Repository

## Overview

This repository contains my work for the **Snow-Crash** project from the 42
curriculum.

It serves **two distinct purposes**:

1. **42 Project Submissions**  
   Required materials, notes, and artifacts related to completing the Snow-Crash
   project as part of the 42 program.

2. **Security Assessment Portfolio**  
   A separate, professional cybersecurity report that documents Snow-Crash as a
   simulated vulnerable Linux environment, written using industry-aligned
   security reporting standards.

These two components are intentionally separated to ensure:
- compliance with 42 policies
- ethical disclosure
- clarity for evaluators and recruiters
